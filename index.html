     <p style="font-family:verdana;color:darkgreen">There once was a widower who remarried. His second wife was illnatured, and she had two daughters who were just as unpleasant as  their mother. The man had a beautiful, gentle daughter of his own, and  she was soon to become the servant of her evil step-mother and stepsisters. They made her do all the chores around the house, and she was  named Cinderella, after the cinders she swept out of the fireplace.</p>
	
     <p style="font-family:verdana;color:darkblue;">The King needed to find a queen for his prince, so he threw a huge ball.  The evil step-mother and step-sisters were invited, but Cinderella was  not allowed to go. <br>After they left, Cinderella&rsquo;s fairy godmother appeared  and changed her dirty rags into a beautiful gown with glass slippers.  Next the fairy godmother changed a pumpkin into a coach and some  mice into footmen. Before Cinderella left, the fairy godmother warned  her to be home before midnight, because the spell would only last till  then.</p>
	
     <p style="font-family:verdana;color:crimson;">Cinderella was a hit at the ball. The prince fell in love with her and asked  her name. Just then the clock struck midnight, and Cinderella ran away.  She was in such a hurry, she lost one of her glass slippers. It was the  only clue the prince had to find his true love. He went to every home in  the kingdom and had every single young girl try on the slipper to see if  it fit. The evil step-sisters could not fit the slipper, but Cinderella did.  The prince married her and they all lived happily ever after.</p>
